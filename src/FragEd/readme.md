## Testing The Rock Kickass Editor

There is a "fake" FragEd project directory in our dropbox folder under the `editor` directory. Copy this folder to `c:/temp/` so the full directory path should be `c:/temp/rockkickass/`.

Then set FragEd as the startup project, and run the project. Open the `testing.fed` file in the root of the FragEd directory. This will load the Content Files, levels and game dlls in the `rockkickass` folder you copied earlier.
